# Loan Prediction from Bank

This project focuses on building a predictive model for loan approvals based on various customer data. It includes preprocessing steps, feature selection, model training, and deployment via a Flask web interface for easy access.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to predict loan approvals using bank data. The following steps are taken to build and deploy the model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Identify and treat outliers
   - Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the data to understand trends and relationships
   - Select relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction

3. **Model Building**:
   - Build the model using scikit-learn
   - Train the model with the prepared data
   - Save the trained model for future use in predictions

4. **Flask Web Interface**:
   - Implement a simple Flask web interface
   - Create an endpoint to allow users to input data and get predictions

## Installation

To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask
